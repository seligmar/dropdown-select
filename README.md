A beautiful, accessible dropdown select

# Accessibility

Many of the most basic components used across web applicatios are more complex than they first appear- at least, if the dev is working against or unaware of the accessibility built into html by default. This is certainly true of the humble dropdown select. Much like the humble button, we only notice a dropdown select when it fails to work.

A note on the underlying html of this page: many demos of this nature fail to pay attention to the underlying structure of the page. This page attempts to avoid that issue by including the appropriate underlying tags.
